"Gender Gap among Nation Origins and Enterprises"
In our seminar we analyzed a data set from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency.
The Enterprise PUDB contains data on single-family and multifamily mortgages purchased by the Federal National Mortgage Association (**Fannie Mae**) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (**Freddie Mac**) for calendar year 2019.

Our goal is to investigate the data set to test our research question, which is: does the data set have a gender and ethnicity gap between different Enterprises?
